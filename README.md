# Drupal UI Pattern Example

This code was written to support the article [Drupal UI Patterns:
Component Driven Development in Drupal](http://jigarius.com/node/8) on
[jigarius.com](http://jigarius.com/).

## See the code in action

To see the code in action, do the following:

* This repo contains a theme declaration. Download the code for this repository
  and rename the directory to `oldie`.
* Place the `oldie` directory in to a Drupal installation such that
  `oldie.info.yml` is located at `themes/custom/oldie/oldie.info.yml`.
* Enable the `oldie` theme and set it as default.
* Install the [ui_patterns](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns) module
  with the *UI Patterns Library* module.
* Login to your website as an administrator and visit the `/patterns` page.

You should now see a pattern named *Blockquote* on the page with 2 variants.
